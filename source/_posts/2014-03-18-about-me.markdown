I am studying for a Masters Degree in Software Engineering and Telecoms, at the INSA de Lyon, an Engineering School in France.

I'm interested in software and web development and particularly focus on middlewares and web API designing. So I have good Java and Java EE skills (Spring Framework, JPA, REST). and PHP (Symfony2) too .

I have a part-time job as a junior developer (web and middlewares) at ETIC INSA Technologies, the INSA Lyon junior company.

Actually, with 2 other guys, we are developing a geo-tracking server and web app,  for an important sport event organized in April by my university ( RAID INSA Lyon).
Hobbies : I practise Triathlon, and I'm a good 10 km runner (often in the top 5, French U23 category)
