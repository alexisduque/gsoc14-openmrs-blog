Hey, let's start for a pre-start weekly report ! As mentioned in my previous post, goals this week were to wrap up the timeline and UI, fixing priorities and begin coding (officially not really ;-)
So, week starts with a cool hangout with my mentor. Talking with Burke is really a nice time, a good exercise for me to practise my spoken english, and to be more comfortable with OpenMRS developers community.

Burke gave grant me access to a dev server (Ubuntu 14.04 :+1:) hosted by DigitalOcean. Abolutely unknown Cloud provider in France ! I will often push my work to share it with OpenMRS developers. You can have a look here : [Atlas Server 2.0][1].

On other hand, we have interesting email discussions with Elliott, about SSO, Auth stategy, and [OpenMRS ID project][2] (assigned to Wiehwa). As I'm really interested in security topics, it was really cool. Elliott looks to be an expert and I learnt a lot. :bowtie:

**What has been done this week :**

 - Refactoring Atlas Server with Laravel
 - Atlas multipass auth strategy, allowing a user to authenticate with his OpenMRS ID in Altas Server.
 - Add a dropdown menu providing controls for future marker management function.
 - Add icons (trash, pencil, pad lock) on the bottom right corner of marker bubble.

{% img center images/bubble-me.png User owned marker %} 
{% img right images/bubble.png A maker bubble %} 

**Next Week Planning : **

 - Discuss Atlas database re-designing.
 - User can create and edit a new marker (marker data not yet saved, just UI).

 See you next week with update.  :smirk:
