Before I start coding and working really on Atlas project, I began to plan my work, precising project timeline, and functionnalities I will implement this summer.

So during these few weeks of community bonding, with the precious help of Burke, I will design some protoypes, mockups and user stories to have a clear idea of how a user will interact with new Atlas Module release.



** See you next week ! ** :smile:	

*PS : Maybe I will post a quick introduction to Multipass SSO. I'm getting some documentation about it, to be able to work with. I thought it's a good idea sharing new skills with you :-)*

##Here is a first Timeline prototype :

###21 April – 18 May

 - Getting familiar with Atlas Module and OpenMRS ID SSO ***(work in progress)***
 - Fixing some Atlas related Tickets ***(done)***
 - Designing the project Road Map ***(work in progress)***
    -  Story Board
    -  Mockup
    -  Timeline week by week
- Community bonding participating in community events ***(work in progress)***

- Add Sign In form for OpenMRS ID 
- Add OpenMRS ID SSO dependency in Atlas Module.
 
###1 June 1 – 30 June
- User can sign in successfully with his OpenMRS ID in Atlas Module
- Atlas Module ported to OpenRMS 2.0 (whith a look like google app style)

###1 July – 12 July
 - An existing marker can be associated with an OpenMRS ID in Atlas Module.

A marker can be created and updated directly in the Atlas Server.
