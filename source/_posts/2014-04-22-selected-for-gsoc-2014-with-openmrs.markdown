I'm proud to announce that I've been choosen as **Google Summer of Code 2014** student to code this summer with **OpenMRS** !

Thanks for the community to trust me. Now, I will do my best effort to make this project a success, to become an active member of OpenMRS contributor community.

Thanks to **Burke, my mentor**, for giving me some tips writing my proposal. 
I'm **very excited** to start working together :-)

See you soon, for detailed timeline and weekly news about the **Atlas Module Project** !
