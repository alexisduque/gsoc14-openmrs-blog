We are ten days before official GSOC begining , and I'm so impatient to start !

This week was a productive week :+1:

 - First hangout with Burke, my mentor. It was really nice to see and chat with him, even if I am a bit shy :relaxed:
 - Timeline adjustement.
 - New mockup and screenshot.
 - Discussion about SSO strategies for OpenMRS ID sign-in within Atlas Server.
 - I set up a local instance of OpenMRS ID Dashboard. I was a bit painful with OpenLDAP configuration, but I'm now ready to test authentification. :sweat_smile:
 - Some hack around SSO and multipass implementation for atlas.
 - I Start to refactor Atlas Server with Laravel, a great PHP Framework.

**TODO**

 * Review mockups with Burke
 * Finish Atlas upgrade to Laravel
 * Timeline wrapping up
