###Project Introduction
![][1]

**Atlas Module** has been developed during GSoC 2011, as a module, but because of various reasons, it hasnâ€™t been yet used a lot.

This project aims to make a version of the Atlas Module to be distributed within **OpenMRS 2.0** as an app, including an implementation's marker to be associated with an **OpenMRS ID**, allowing for a the marker to be created or revised outside of the module, directly on the Atlas Website. 

To easilier manage markers, **Atlas website** backend will be modified with new functionnalities, allowing to delete, or move markers.
